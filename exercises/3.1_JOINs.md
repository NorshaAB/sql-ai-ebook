## ðŸ’¡ AI Explanation

```sql
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.Total > 100;
```
**Why it works**:  
- INNER JOIN links only customers with purchases  
- WHERE filters for purchases over $100  
- You can add an index on `CustomerId` in `invoices` to improve performance
